## Creating module in angular js
we use ".module" parameter while defining a variable to create a module in angular js like
var app = angular.module('gemStore', []);

where app is the variable which has gemStore as module. The blank array i.e. [] is kept as good practise. This array can have dependencies declared later on if required.
